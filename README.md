Breakout

This project is the second assignment of the CS50 Introduction to Video Game Development:

https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-game-development

The objective of this activity was to add some new to an implimentation of the classic arcade game Break implimented in Lua for LÃ–VE 2D. 

1) A Powerup class for spawning collectables that confer some interesting effects (ie. multi-ball modes).

2) Dynamic resized of the game paddle based on the number of lives that are left.

3) Locked bricks that require specific power-ups to break.
